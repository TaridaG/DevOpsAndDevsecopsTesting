This repository serves as a comprehensive playground for experimenting with modern DevOps and DevSecOps practices, tooling, and cloud-native technologies.
The project is built on a Java/Maven foundation and will continuously evolve as new integrations, pipelines, and security automations are added.
The goal of this repository is to simulate a real-world end-to-end environment where various infrastructure, CI/CD, observability, and security tools can be integrated, tested, and benchmarked. It will grow into a fully-featured ecosystem for hands-on learning and experimentation.
